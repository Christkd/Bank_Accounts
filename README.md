Bank Accounts Small Project

*This is a small project and practice of Python coding, it is of personal use only, to showcase and track my progress as an independent developer.*

- for bankac0.py, I simulated bank accounts and transactions done between those accounts. It will show information for deposits, withdrawals and the ending balance.
- for bankacc.py, I simulated Users with bank accounts, their credentials and their total balance.

- Each Python document needs to be runned through the terminal to be displayed. Below is a screenshot of how it should look:
