Bank Accounts Small Project

*This is a small project and practice of Python coding, it is of personal use only, to showcase and track my progress as an independent developer.*

- On this small project, I simulated bank accounts and transactions done between those accounts. It will show information for deposits, withdrawals and the ending balance.

- I will share a screenshot, to show how it should look.
